To control two LEDs using a push button, we will implement the following behavior:

LED1 will turn ON when the button is pressed.
LED2 will turn OFF when the button is released.
Components Needed:
Arduino Uno
2 LEDs (LED1 and LED2)
1 Push Button
Resistors (220 ohms for each LED)
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)
Circuit Diagram:
LED1 connected to pin 8.
LED2 connected to pin 9.
Push button connected to pin 2 (with a pull-down resistor).
Wiring the Components:
Connect the anode (long leg) of LED1 to pin 8 through a 220-ohm resistor.
Connect the anode (long leg) of LED2 to pin 9 through a 220-ohm resistor.
Connect the cathode (short leg) of both LEDs to GND.
Connect one terminal of the push button to pin 2.
Connect the other terminal of the push button to GND with a pull-down resistor, or use INPUT_PULLUP to internally pull the input to HIGH when the button is not pressed.
Arduino Code:
cpp


// Define the pin numbers for LEDs and button
const int buttonPin = 2;  // Push button connected to pin 2
const int led1Pin = 8;    // LED1 connected to pin 8
const int led2Pin = 9;    // LED2 connected to pin 9

void setup() {
  // Set the LED pins as OUTPUT
  pinMode(led1Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led2Pin, OUTPUT);
  
  // Set the button pin as INPUT
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);  // Using internal pull-up resistor
}

void loop() {
  // Read the state of the button
  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
  
  // Check if the button is pressed (LOW due to INPUT_PULLUP)
  if (buttonState == LOW) {
    // Button is pressed: turn ON LED1 and turn OFF LED2
    digitalWrite(led1Pin, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(led2Pin, LOW);
  } else {
    // Button is released: turn OFF LED1 and turn ON LED2
    digitalWrite(led1Pin, LOW);
    digitalWrite(led2Pin, HIGH);
  }
}


How the Program Works:
The button state is continuously checked in the loop().
When the button is pressed (LOW because of the INPUT_PULLUP configuration), LED1 turns ON and LED2 turns OFF.
When the button is released (HIGH), LED1 turns OFF and LED2 turns ON.
Steps to Simulate on Tinkercad:
Set up the circuit in Tinkercad by wiring the two LEDs, push button, and resistors as described.
Copy and paste the code into the code editor in Tinkercad.
Click Start Simulation.
When you press the button, LED1 should turn ON and LED2 should turn OFF.
When you release the button, LED1 should turn OFF and LED2 should turn ON.
This is a simple demonstration of controlling two LEDs with a single push button, but the logic can be extended to more complex scenarios depending on your needs. Let me know if you need any further clarification!
