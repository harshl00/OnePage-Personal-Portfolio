<h2>Question:</h2>
    <p>2. Interface IR sensor on Arduino Uno. Write an arduino  program to detect obstacle using IR sensor and display the result on the serial monitor.       </p>
    <h2>Code:</h2>
    <pre>

const int irSensorPin = 2;
int irSensorState = 0;

void setup() {
  pinMode(irSensorPin, INPUT);
  
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  irSensorState = digitalRead(irSensorPin);
  
  if (irSensorState == LOW) {
    Serial.println("Obstacle Detected!");
  } else {
    Serial.println("No Obstacle");
  }

  delay(500);
}

    </pre>
<pre>
To interface an IR sensor with the Arduino Uno and detect obstacles, follow these steps:

---

### **Components Needed:**
1. Arduino Uno board
2. IR sensor module (e.g., IR proximity or obstacle detection sensor)
3. Jumper wires
4. Breadboard (optional)

---

### **Connections:**

1. **IR Sensor Connections:**
   - **VCC** (IR sensor) → **5V** on Arduino
   - **GND** (IR sensor) → **GND** on Arduino
   - **OUT** (IR sensor) → **Pin 2** on Arduino (defined in the code as `irSensorPin`)

2. **Arduino Connections:**
   - Connect the IR sensor’s output pin (`OUT`) to **digital pin 2** on the Arduino.

---

### **Key Notes:**
- Most IR sensors have a **power indicator LED** and an **obstacle detection LED**:
  - The **power LED** stays on as long as the sensor has power.
  - The **detection LED** turns on when an obstacle is detected.
- Some IR sensors include a potentiometer to adjust the detection range. You can fine-tune this depending on your application.

---

### **How It Works:**
- When the IR sensor detects an obstacle:
  - The `OUT` pin of the IR sensor sends a **LOW signal** to the Arduino.
  - The code checks the sensor state using `digitalRead(irSensorPin)`.
  - If `LOW` is read, the serial monitor displays **"Obstacle Detected!"**.
  - Otherwise, it displays **"No Obstacle"**.

---

### **Diagram:**

| IR Sensor Pin | Arduino Pin |
|---------------|-------------|
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |
| OUT           | Pin 2       |

---

### **Testing:**
1. Open the **Serial Monitor** in the Arduino IDE.
2. Set the baud rate to **9600** (matching `Serial.begin(9600)` in the code).
3. Place an object in front of the IR sensor:
   - If the obstacle is detected, you will see **"Obstacle Detected!"** in the serial monitor.
   - If there's no obstacle, it will display **"No Obstacle"**.

This setup and code should allow you to successfully detect obstacles using an IR sensor.

<h2>Question:</h2>
    <p>3. Interface PIR sensor on Arduino Uno. Write an arduino  program for motion detection using PIR sensor and display the result on the serial monitor.       </p>
    <h2>Code:</h2>
    <pre>

const int pirSensorPin = 2; 
int motionState = 0;

void setup() {
  pinMode(pirSensorPin, INPUT);
  
  Serial.begin(9600);
  
  Serial.println("PIR Sensor Motion Detection Initialized...");
}

void loop() {
  motionState = digitalRead(pirSensorPin);

  if (motionState == HIGH) {
    Serial.println("Motion Detected!");
  } else {
    Serial.println("No Motion");
  }
  
  delay(500);
}


    </pre>
<pre>
To interface a PIR sensor with the Arduino Uno for motion detection, follow these steps:

---

### **Components Needed:**
1. Arduino Uno board
2. PIR motion sensor (e.g., HC-SR501)
3. Jumper wires
4. Breadboard (optional)

---

### **Connections:**

1. **PIR Sensor Connections:**
   - **VCC** (PIR sensor) → **5V** on Arduino
   - **GND** (PIR sensor) → **GND** on Arduino
   - **OUT** (PIR sensor) → **Pin 2** on Arduino (defined in the code as `pirSensorPin`)

2. **Arduino Connections:**
   - Connect the PIR sensor's `OUT` pin to **digital pin 2** on the Arduino.

---

### **How It Works:**
- When the PIR sensor detects motion, it outputs a **HIGH signal** on the `OUT` pin.
- The Arduino reads this signal using `digitalRead(pirSensorPin)`:
  - If motion is detected (`HIGH`), the serial monitor displays **"Motion Detected!"**.
  - If no motion is detected (`LOW`), it displays **"No Motion"**.

---

### **PIR Sensor Basics:**
- **Adjustable Settings:**
  - **Sensitivity**: Determines the detection range (adjusted using a potentiometer on the PIR sensor).
  - **Delay Time**: The time the `OUT` pin stays HIGH after motion is detected (also adjusted via potentiometer).
- **Warm-Up Time**: Most PIR sensors require 20–60 seconds to stabilize after power-on.

---

### **Connections Table:**

| PIR Sensor Pin | Arduino Pin |
|----------------|-------------|
| VCC            | 5V          |
| GND            | GND         |
| OUT            | Pin 2       |

---

### **Testing:**
1. Power up the Arduino.
2. Open the **Serial Monitor** in the Arduino IDE.
3. Set the baud rate to **9600** (matching `Serial.begin(9600)` in the code).
4. After the PIR sensor stabilizes:
   - Wave your hand or create motion in front of the sensor.
   - If motion is detected, the serial monitor will display **"Motion Detected!"**.
   - If no motion is detected, it will display **"No Motion"**.

---

### **Example Serial Output:**
```
PIR Sensor Motion Detection Initialized...
No Motion
No Motion
Motion Detected!
No Motion
```

This setup and code will enable you to detect motion using a PIR sensor and display the results on the Arduino serial monitor.

   - Pedestrian lights: **Green OFF**, **Red ON**
   - Buttons wait for user input.

2. **When the Car Button is Pressed:**
   - The system transitions to the **car light sequence**:
     - **Red OFF**, **Yellow ON** (for 1 second), **Green ON**
   - Pedestrian lights reset to **Red ON**, **Green OFF**.

3. **When the Pedestrian Button is Pressed:**
   - The system transitions to the **pedestrian light sequence**:
     - Car lights change: **Green OFF**, **Yellow ON** (for 1 second), **Red ON**.
     - Pedestrian lights change: **Red OFF**, **Green ON**.

4. The system toggles between states when either button is pressed.

---

### **Testing:**

1. Power up the Arduino and ensure all LEDs and buttons are connected correctly.
2. Observe the default state: **Car green** and **Pedestrian red**.
3. Press the car button:
   - The car signal transitions to **green**, while the pedestrian signal transitions to **red**.
4. Press the pedestrian button:
   - The pedestrian signal transitions to **green**, while the car signal transitions to **red**.

This setup will simulate an interactive traffic light system.

<h2>Question:</h2>
    <p>6. Interface RFID reader on Arduino UNO. Write an arduino program to demonstrate Security access. Display the suitable messages on the serial monitor.    </p>
    <h2>Code:</h2>
    <pre>

Components Required:
Arduino UNO
RFID Reader Module (e.g., RC522)
RFID Cards/Tags
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)
Steps to Set Up the System:
Connect the hardware:

Connect the SDA pin of the RC522 to Pin 10 of the Arduino.

Connect the SCK pin of the RC522 to Pin 13 of the Arduino.
Connect the MOSI pin of the RC522 to Pin 11 of the Arduino.

Connect the MISO pin of the RC522 to Pin 12 of the Arduino.
Connect the RST pin of the RC522 to Pin 9 of the Arduino.

Connect the GND pin of the RC522 to GND on the Arduino.
Connect the 3.3V pin of the RC522 to 3.3V on the Arduino.

Install the MFRC522 library: Before you start writing the code, you need to install the MFRC522 library for interfacing the RC522 RFID reader with the Arduino.


Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries.
In the Library Manager, search for MFRC522 and install it.
Write the Arduino code:
 The code below reads the RFID tag and checks whether the UID (Unique Identifier) of the RFID matches the pre-stored one. If it matches, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.


#include <SPI.h>            // Include the SPI library
#include <MFRC522.h>        // Include the MFRC522 library

#define SS_PIN 10           // Pin for Slave Select (SDA)
#define RST_PIN 9           // Pin for Reset (RST)

MFRC522 mfrc522(SS_PIN, RST_PIN);  // Create an instance of the MFRC522 class

// Define the UID of the authorized RFID tag
byte authorizedUID[] = {0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF};  // Change this to your RFID tag's UID

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);  // Start the Serial Monitor
  SPI.begin();         // Start the SPI communication
  mfrc522.PCD_Init();  // Initialize the MFRC522 RFID reader
  
  Serial.println("Place your RFID tag near the reader.");
}

void loop() {
  // Check if a new RFID card is present
  if (mfrc522.PICC_IsNewCardPresent()) {
    // Read the UID of the RFID tag
    if (mfrc522.PICC_ReadCardSerial()) {
      Serial.print("UID of the tag: ");
      
      // Display the UID of the scanned RFID card
      for (byte i = 0; i < mfrc522.uid.size; i++) {
        Serial.print(mfrc522.uid.uidByte[i], HEX);
        Serial.print(" ");
      }
      Serial.println();
      
      // Check if the UID matches the authorized one
      if (checkUID()) {
        Serial.println("Access Granted!");
      } else {
        Serial.println("Access Denied!");
      }
      
      // Halt the current RFID card and prepare for the next one
      mfrc522.PICC_HaltA();
      mfrc522.PCD_StopCrypto1();
    }
  }
}

// Function to check if the scanned UID matches the authorized UID
bool checkUID() {
  if (mfrc522.uid.size != sizeof(authorizedUID)) {
    return false;  // If the UID size doesn't match, it's not authorized
  }
  
  for (byte i = 0; i < mfrc522.uid.size; i++) {
    if (mfrc522.uid.uidByte[i] != authorizedUID[i]) {
      return false;  // If any byte of the UID doesn't match, deny access
    }
  }
  
  return true;  // If the UID matches, grant access
}
tep 4: Upload the Code to Arduino
Connect your Arduino UNO to the computer using a USB cable.
Open the Arduino IDE and paste the code into the IDE.

Select Arduino UNO as the board type in the Tools → Board menu.
Select the correct COM port in Tools → Port.
Click on the Upload button (right arrow)
 to upload the code to the Arduino.
Step 5: Open the Serial Monitor
After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (Tools → Serial Monitor).

Set the baud rate to 9600.
Place your RFID tag near the reader, and you should see the UID printed in the Serial Monitor. If it matches the pre-stored UID, 
you will see "Access Granted!"; otherwise, it will say "Access Denied!".

<h2>Question:</h2>
    <p>3. 7. Interface Servo Motor and Potentiometer on arduino Uno. Write an Arduino program to    perform the following     i) to control the servo motor with potentiometer.    </p>
    <h2>Code:</h2>
    <pre>

#include <Servo.h>

Servo servo; // Create servo object
int potPin = A0; // Potentiometer connected to A0
int potValue;    // Variable to store potentiometer value
int angle;       // Variable to store servo angle

void setup() {
  servo.attach(9); // Attach servo to pin 9
  Serial.begin(9600); // Initialize Serial Monitor
}

void loop() {
  potValue = analogRead(potPin); // Read potentiometer value
  angle = map(potValue, 0, 1023, 0, 180); // Map potentiometer value to servo angle
  servo.write(angle); // Move servo to the mapped angle
  Serial.print("Potentiometer Value: ");
  Serial.print(potValue);
  Serial.print(" | Servo Angle: ");
  Serial.println(angle);
  delay(15); // Small delay for smooth movement
}



    </pre>
<pre>
To control a servo motor using a potentiometer with an Arduino Uno, follow these steps:

---

### **Components Needed:**
1. Arduino Uno board  
2. Servo motor  
3. Potentiometer (10kΩ recommended)  
4. Jumper wires  
5. Breadboard  

---

### **Connections:**

1. **Servo Motor:**
   - **Signal wire (Yellow/Orange)** → Connect to **pin 9** on Arduino (as defined in the code).
   - **Power wire (Red)** → Connect to **5V** on Arduino.
   - **Ground wire (Brown/Black)** → Connect to **GND** on Arduino.

2. **Potentiometer:**
   - **Center pin (wiper)** → Connect to **A0** on Arduino (as defined in the code).
   - **Left pin** → Connect to **5V** on Arduino.
   - **Right pin** → Connect to **GND** on Arduino.

---

### **Connections Table:**

| Component      | Arduino Pin | Description                |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Servo Signal   | Pin 9       | Servo control signal       |
| Servo Power    | 5V          | Power for servo motor      |
| Servo Ground   | GND         | Common ground for servo    |
| Potentiometer Wiper | A0     | Reads analog value from potentiometer |
| Potentiometer Left Pin | 5V  | Provides power to potentiometer |
| Potentiometer Right Pin | GND| Ground connection for potentiometer |

---

### **How It Works:**

1. **Potentiometer Reads:**
   - The potentiometer provides an analog value (0 to 1023) based on its rotation.
   - This value is read using `analogRead(potPin)`.

2. **Mapping Values:**
   - The `map()` function converts the potentiometer's value (0–1023) into an angle range (0–180 degrees) for the servo motor.

3. **Servo Control:**
   - The `servo.write(angle)` command moves the servo to the corresponding angle.

4. **Serial Monitor Output:**
   - The potentiometer value and the mapped servo angle are displayed on the serial monitor for debugging and observation.

---

### **Testing:**

1. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
2. Connect all components as described.
3. Open the **Serial Monitor** in the Arduino IDE.
4. Rotate the potentiometer and observe:
   - The servo motor moves to angles between 0° and 180° depending on the potentiometer's position.
   - The potentiometer value and servo angle are displayed on the serial monitor.

---

### **Serial Monitor Output Example:**

```
Potentiometer Value: 512 | Servo Angle: 90
Potentiometer Value: 1023 | Servo Angle: 180
Potentiometer Value: 0 | Servo Angle: 0
```

This setup provides precise control of the servo motor using the potentiometer.

9. Interface an LED on Raspberry pi. Implement a python  program to implement blink an LED for four times with a delay of  three seconds.                              
Your Python code for blinking an LED four times with a delay of three seconds looks almost perfect! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to **interface an LED** with the **Raspberry Pi** and run your code successfully:

### **Components Needed:**
1. **Raspberry Pi** (any model with GPIO pins, e.g., Raspberry Pi 3 or 4)
2. **LED**
3. **330Ω Resistor** (for current-limiting)
4. **Jumper Wires**
5. **Breadboard** (optional)

---

### **Step 1: Connect the LED to the Raspberry Pi**

1. **Insert the LED on the breadboard** (optional) with the longer leg (anode) being the positive (+) side and the shorter leg (cathode) being the negative (-) side.
   
2. **Connect the Anode (longer leg)** of the LED to **GPIO pin 18** on the Raspberry Pi.

3. **Connect the Cathode (shorter leg)** of the LED to the **ground (GND)** on the Raspberry Pi **through a 330Ω resistor**. This resistor helps protect the LED from too much current.

   - Pin **18** → Anode of the LED.
   - The Cathode of the LED → Resistor → **GND (Ground)** on the Raspberry Pi.

Here’s a simple wiring diagram:

- **GPIO pin 18** → **Anode (long leg) of LED**.
- **Cathode (short leg) of LED** → **330Ω Resistor** → **GND**.

---

### **Step 2: Set Up the Raspberry Pi for Python GPIO**

1. **Make sure you have RPi.GPIO installed** (it usually comes pre-installed with the Raspberry Pi OS). If not, you can install it using the following command in the terminal:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Create the Python Program to Blink the LED**

1. **Open the terminal** on your Raspberry Pi.
   
2. **Navigate to the directory** where you want to save your Python program (e.g., Desktop):
   
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop
   ```

3. **Create a new Python file**:
   
   ```bash
   nano blink_led.py
   ```

4. **Write the Python code** to blink the LED four times with a 3-second delay:

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO  # Import the GPIO library
import time  # Import the time library for delays

# Set up GPIO mode to BCM (Broadcom pin-numbering scheme)
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Set GPIO pin 18 as output (where the LED is connected)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)

# Blink the LED 4 times
for _ in range(4):
    GPIO.output(18, GPIO.HIGH)  # Turn LED on (3.3V)
    time.sleep(3)  # Wait for 3 seconds
    GPIO.output(18, GPIO.LOW)   # Turn LED off (0V)
    time.sleep(3)  # Wait for 3 seconds

# Clean up the GPIO pins (turn off the pin)
GPIO.cleanup()
```

5. **Save the file** by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save the file.

---

### **Step 4: Run the Python Program**

1. **Run the Python program** by typing the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   python3 blink_led.py
   ```

2. **Observe the LED**:
   - The LED should blink **4 times**, with each blink having a delay of **3 seconds** (on for 3 seconds, off for 3 seconds).

---

### **Step 5: Troubleshooting**

If the LED doesn't blink, check the following:

1. **Wiring**:
   - Ensure the connections are correct (GPIO pin 18, Resistor, and Ground).
   
2. **GPIO Pin**:
   - Ensure you’re using the correct GPIO pin (pin 18) and that the pin is not being used by another process.

3. **GPIO Library**:
   - Ensure you have the RPi.GPIO library installed (use `sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio`).

4. **Permission**:
   - Ensure you're running the program with proper permissions.

---

### **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you have successfully interfaced an LED with your Raspberry Pi and created a Python program that blinks the LED four times with a 3-second delay. This can be a starting point for more advanced projects, such as controlling multiple LEDs, adding sensors, or integrating with web services!

10. Interface pi camera module on Raspberry pi. Implement a python program to capture images and to record video.



Experiment No: 8
Equipment Needed:
Raspberry Pi (any model with a camera interface).

Raspberry Pi Camera Module (version 1 or 2).
VGA Cable (though typically, a monitor with HDMI would be used to connect the Pi, but this can depend on your setup).

Power Cable for the Raspberry Pi.




Step 1: Connect the Camera Module to the Raspberry Pi
Connect the Raspberry Pi Camera Module to the camera interface (CSI port) on your Raspberry Pi.

Make sure the blue ribbon on the camera is facing towards the Ethernet port (or USB ports if your Pi model does not have an Ethernet port).

The ribbon cable should be inserted properly into the CSI connector, and the connector latch should be pressed back in to secure it.


Step 2: Open the Terminal and Navigate to Desktop
On your Raspberry Pi, open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.

Change the directory to the Desktop: code
cd ~/Desktop/



Step 3: Enable the Camera
Now, run the following command to open the Raspberry Pi Configuration Tool:sudo raspi-config
In 
the configuration menu:

Navigate to Interfacing Options.
Select Camera.
Choose Yes to enable the camera.
After enabling,
the tool will prompt you to reboot your Raspberry Pi. Select Yes to reboot.


Step 4: Install the picamera Python Library
You’ll need the picamera library to interact with the camera in Python. To install it, run:

bash
Copy code

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-picamera
This ensures that the picamera library is installed and ready for use in Python.





Step 5: Write the Python Program to Capture an Image and Record Video
Create a Python script using nano to write the program.

nano cameraexample.py

write the following Python code into the file:

python
Copy code


import picamera
import time

# Initialize the camera
camera = picamera.PICamera()

# Capture an image
camera.capture('example.jpg')

# Flip the camera vertically
camera.vflip = True

# Capture another image
camera.capture('example2.jpg')

# Start recording video (5 seconds)
camera.start_recording('examplevid.h264')
time.sleep(5)  # Record for 5 seconds
camera.stop_recording()  # Stop recording
After writing the code, save and exit by pressing CTRL + X, then Y, and finally Enter.





Step 6: Run the Python Script
To run the script, simply type:
python3 cameraexample.py
This will:

Take two photos (example.jpg and example2.jpg).
Flip the camera vertically.
Record a video (examplevid.h264) for 5 seconds.





Step 7: View the Recorded Video
To view the recorded video (examplevid.h264), use omxplayer (a media player built for the Raspberry Pi).
omxplayer examplevid.h264
This will open the video in a player, and you’ll be able to view it.



11. Interface DHT22 sensor on Raspberry pi. Implement a python program to read the temperature and humidity and display the result on the terminal.      



Circuit Design
If you observe the circuit diagram, there is not a lot of stuff going on with respect to the
connections. All you need to do is to connect the VCC and GND pins of the DHT11 Sensor to
+5V and GND of Raspberry Pi and then connect the Data OUT of the Sensor to the GPIO4 i.e.
Physical Pin 7 of the Raspberry Pi.      

First step is to download the library from GitHub. But before this, I have created a folder called
‘library’ on the desktop of the Raspberry Pi to place the downloaded files. You don’t have to
do that.
Now, enter the following command to download the files related to the Adafruit_DHT library.



cd library
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git



All the contents will be downloaded to a folder called ‘Adafruit_Python_DHT’. Open this
directory using cd Adafruit_Python_DHT. To see the contents of this folder, use ‘ls’ command.
In that folder, there is file called ‘setup.py’. We need to install this file using the following
command.
sudo python setup.py install


Code
As we are using the library Adafruit_DHT for this project, there is nothing much to do in the
Python Programming part. All you need to do is to invoke the library with the Sensor and
GPIO Pin and print the values of Temperature and Humidity.
import sys
import Adafruit_DHT
import time
49 | P a g e
while True:
 humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(22, 4)
 print 'Temp: {0:0.1f} C Humidity: {1:0.1f} %'.format(temperature, humidity)
 time.sleep(1)





12. Interface Ultra Sonic HC-SR04 on raspberry pi. Implement a python program to measure the distance(in cm) from obstacle    


Sl no. Equipment’s Needed
1 Raspberry Pi Model 3
2 Raspberry Pi ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
3 VGA cable
4 Power Cable



Step 2: Connecting the HC-SR04 to the Raspberry Pi
Now, let’s connect the sensor to the Raspberry Pi using jumper wires:


Connect the VCC Pin of the HC-SR04 to the 5V pin on the Raspberry Pi.


Raspberry Pi Pin 2 (5V) → HC-SR04 VCC
Connect the GND Pin of the HC-SR04 to the GND pin on the Raspberry Pi.


Raspberry Pi Pin 6 (Ground) → HC-SR04 GND
Connect the TRIG Pin of the HC-SR04 to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi (for example, GPIO 4).


Raspberry Pi Pin 7 (GPIO 4) → HC-SR04 TRIG
Connect the ECHO Pin of the HC-SR04 to another GPIO pin (for example, GPIO 18).

Raspberry Pi Pin 12 (GPIO 18) → HC-SR04 ECHO

Important Note: The Echo pin on the HC-SR04 sends a 5V signal, but the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins can only handle 3.3V safely. 
So you should use a voltage divider (with two resistors, 330Ω and 470Ω) to drop the 5V signal down to 3.3V for the Raspberry Pi.




Step 3: Build the Voltage Divider for the Echo Pin
To protect the Raspberry Pi from the higher voltage on the Echo pin, we use a voltage divider.


Here’s how to wire the voltage divider:

330Ω Resistor → Connect between the Echo pin (HC-SR04) 
and GPIO 18 on the Raspberry Pi.
470Ω Resistor → Connect between GPIO 18 and Ground.

This will reduce the 5V signal to around 3.3V, which is safe for the Raspberry Pi GPIO.


Step 4: Setting Up the Raspberry Pi
Connect your Raspberry Pi to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, or access it remotely using SSH.

Update your Raspberry Pi to make sure you have the latest software:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio
nano distance_sensor.py
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO  # Import the GPIO library
import time  # Import the time library for delays

# Set up GPIO mode to BCM (Broadcom pin-numbering scheme)
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Define GPIO pins for Trigger and Echo
TRIG = 4
ECHO = 18

# Set up Trigger pin as output and Echo pin as input
GPIO.setup(TRIG, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(ECHO, GPIO.IN)

# Make sure the Trigger pin is low (inactive)
GPIO.output(TRIG, False)
time.sleep(2)  # Allow some time for the sensor to settle

# Send a pulse from the Trigger pin
GPIO.output(TRIG, True)
time.sleep(0.00001)  # Send a very short pulse
GPIO.output(TRIG, False)

# Measure the time it takes for the Echo pin to go high (reflecting the signal)
while GPIO.input(ECHO) == False:
    start = time.time()

while GPIO.input(ECHO) == True:
    end = time.time()

# Calculate the time difference between start and end
sig_time = end - start

# Calculate the distance using the speed of sound (34300 cm/s)
# Distance = (Time * Speed of Sound) / 2 (round trip)
distance = sig_time * 34300 / 2  # Distance in centimeters

# Print the distance measured
print("Distance: {:.2f} centimeters".format(distance))

# Clean up the GPIO pins after use
GPIO.cleanup()
Save and close the file by pressing CTRL + X, then Y, and Enter.



python3 distance_sensor.py
Distance: 24.56 centimeters
GPIO.cleanup()

Use a voltage divider to reduce the 5V signal from the ECHO pin to 3.3V.
Connect a 330Ω resistor between the ECHO pin and GPIO 18.
Connect a 470Ω resistor between GPIO 18 and Ground.


Voltage Divider for Echo Pin:

ECHO Pin → 330Ω Resistor → GPIO 18 (Raspberry Pi)
                     |
                 470Ω Resistor
                     |
                 Ground
2. Wiring the RGB LEDs to the Raspberry Pi
Each RGB LED has 4 pins:

Red pin
Green pin
Blue pin (we're not using the blue pin in this case)
Common cathode 
(or anode, depending on the type of LED; we assume common cathode for simplicity).
We will control the Red, Green, and Yellow LEDs using GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.


Wiring the RGB LEDs:
Green LED:

Green LED pin → GPIO 17 (Pin 11).
Connect a 220Ω resistor in series to limit the current.

Step 8: Troubleshooting
If the LEDs don’t light up:
Check your wiring connections and ensure that the GPIO pins are correctly set up.
Ensure the 330Ω resistors are connected correctly for each LED to limit current.
If there’s an error:

   - Copy the **Write API Key**. You’ll need this to send data to your channel.

### **Step 2: Connect the ESP8266 to the Temperature Sensor**

1. **Connect the DHT11 or DHT22 sensor** to your **ESP8266**.
   
   **For DHT11/DHT22** sensor (used for temperature and humidity):
   
   - **VCC (DHT11/DHT22)** → 3.3V on ESP8266.
   - **GND (DHT11/DHT22)** → GND on ESP8266.
   - **DATA (DHT11/DHT22)** → GPIO 2 (or any other available GPIO) on ESP8266.
   
   **For LM35** (an analog temperature sensor):
   
   - **VCC (LM35)** → 3.3V on ESP8266.
   - **GND (LM35)** → GND on ESP8266.
   - **OUT (LM35)** → A0 pin on ESP8266 (Analog pin for reading temperature).

---

### **Step 3: Set Up the Arduino IDE**

1. **Install the ESP8266 Board in Arduino IDE**:
   - Open the **Arduino IDE**.
   - Go to **File → Preferences**, and in the **Additional Boards Manager URLs** field, add this URL:  
     ```
     http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
     ```
   - Go to **Tools → Board → Boards Manager**, search for "ESP8266", and click **Install**.
   - Select the correct **ESP8266 board** under **Tools → Board** (e.g., NodeMCU 1.0).

2. **Install DHT Library** (for DHT11/DHT22):
   - Go to **Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries**.
   - Search for **DHT sensor library** by Adafruit and install it.

---

### **Step 4: Write the Arduino Code**

1. **Example Code** for reading temperature from **DHT11/DHT22** and sending it to ThingSpeak:

```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <DHT.h>
#include <ThingSpeak.h>

#define DHTPIN 2 // GPIO2 for DHT22
#define DHTTYPE DHT22 // DHT11 or DHT22

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

const char *ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID"; // Your Wi-Fi SSID
const char *password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"; // Your Wi-Fi Password

unsigned long myChannelNumber = YOUR_CHANNEL_NUMBER; // Channel number from ThingSpeak
const char *myWriteAPIKey = "YOUR_WRITE_API_KEY"; // Your ThingSpeak Write API Key

WiFiClient client;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(10);

  // Connect to Wi-Fi
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  Serial.print("Connecting to Wi-Fi");

  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }

  Serial.println("Connected to Wi-Fi!");

  // Initialize DHT sensor
  dht.begin();

  // Initialize ThingSpeak
  ThingSpeak.begin(client);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the temperature
  float temperature = dht.readTemperature();  // Celsius
  if (isnan(temperature)) {
    Serial.println("Failed to read from DHT sensor!");
    return;
  }

  // Print temperature to Serial Monitor
  Serial.print("Temperature: ");
  Serial.print(temperature);
  Serial.println(" *C");

  // Send data to ThingSpeak
  ThingSpeak.setField(1, temperature); // Field 1 is for temperature
  int x = ThingSpeak.writeFields(myChannelNumber, myWriteAPIKey);

  if (x == 200) {
    Serial.println("Data sent to ThingSpeak successfully!");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Failed to send data to ThingSpeak. HTTP error code: " + String(x));
  }

  // Wait before sending next reading
  delay(15000); // Wait for 15 seconds before sending the next reading
}
```

2. **Replace the following in the code**:
   - **YOUR_WIFI_SSID**: Your Wi-Fi SSID (Network name).
   - **YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD**: Your Wi-Fi password.
   - **YOUR_CHANNEL_NUMBER**: The Channel ID of your ThingSpeak channel (found on the ThingSpeak Channel Settings page).
   - **YOUR_WRITE_API_KEY**: The Write API key from ThingSpeak.

3. **Upload the code** to your ESP8266:
   - Select the correct **board** and **port** in the Arduino IDE.
   - Click **Upload**.

---

### **Step 5: Monitor the Data in ThingSpeak**

1. After the code is uploaded, your ESP8266 will connect to Wi-Fi and start sending temperature data to ThingSpeak.
2. Visit your ThingSpeak channel page to see the **temperature data** visualized in real-time.

   - ThingSpeak will update the data every 15 seconds (based on the `delay(15000)` in the code).
   - You can view the data in **fields** (e.g., Field 1 is for temperature).
   - ThingSpeak provides various ways to visualize the data, such as **line charts** and **bar charts**.

---

### **Step 6: Troubleshooting**

- **If the data is not updating**:
  - Ensure that your ESP8266 is connected to Wi-Fi by checking the serial monitor.
  - Make sure that the **ThingSpeak Write API Key** is correctly set in the code.
  - Check your ThingSpeak channel to ensure it's active and receiving data.
  
- **If the temperature readings are incorrect**:
  - Ensure that the sensor is connected properly.
  - You can check the sensor readings in the **Serial Monitor** to debug.

---

### **Conclusion**

Now, you have successfully demonstrated how to use an **ESP8266** with a **temperature sensor** and send the data to **ThingSpeak** cloud for monitoring. This project is perfect for building IoT-based applications, such as monitoring temperature remotely.

Feel free to expand the project by adding more sensors or automating actions based on the temperature!
