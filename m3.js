Universal Design 
Universal Design (UD) is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be 
accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their 
age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that 
environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not 
a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental 
condition of good design. 
The 7 Principles of Universal Design 
 Equitable use - “The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse 
abilities.”Anyone should be able to use a design regardless of who they are and what 
they’re capable of, and no one should be excluded. Perhaps most importantly, no user 
should feel like their privacy, safety, or security would be compromised if they use a 
given product.For example, high contrast should be used in digital designs in order to 
ensure color-blind users can see all the content on a screen.The basic affordances of 
your design will play a large role in this! 
 Flexibility in use- “The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences 
and abilities.”This principle calls for a design to provide choices that can accommodate 
or appeal to the most possible users. Users should be able to go at their own pace and 
accurately complete tasks no matter what their preferred method of doing so.For 
example, in addition to audio, closed-captioned subtitles should be available for users 
who want to read instead of listen to what is said in a video. This is, of course, a 
necessity for deaf users, but also accommodates the preferences of users who are not 
deaf. 
 Simple and intuitive use- “Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the 
user’s experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.”This 
principle should sound especially familiar to UX designers. Designs shouldn’t be 
needlessly complex, instead they should work with users’ expectations while also 
providing messaging at every stage of a task to ensure a user knows they are on the 
right track.For example, when a user goes to the website or app for a streaming service, 
they should immediately understand how to navigate to the video they want. This may 
mean that the most popular titles are easily accessible at the top of the home page, or if 
the user is looking for something more obscure, the search button is large enough to 
notice and access. 
 Perceptible information“The design communicates necessary information effectively 
to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities.”Important 
information should be presented in multiple ways—say through both pictures and 
words—and designs should be compatible with devices that are used by people with 
physical limitations.For example, text in digital designs should never be presented in a 
long, overwhelming block. Instead, this information should be broken up so the most 
important information is at the top. Bullet points or other methods may also be used to 
further divide the information. In addition, images should be used to emphasize a body

of text’s most important points and to illustrate what the written information is 
conveying. 
 Tolerance for error-“The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of 
accidental or unintended actions.”Designs should eliminate or de-emphasize anything 
that could lead to issues during use. When errors do occur, warnings or other safeguards 
should ensure a user can undo them or stop the error before it happens.For example, if 
you’re browsing a store’s mobile website and accidentally tap the “Buy” button, an 
overlay could pop up confirming you intended to add the item to your cart. That overlay 
would also provide the option to undo the action and remove the item. 
 Low physical effort-“The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a 
minimum of fatigue.”While on first glance this principle seems most relevant to 
architecture where Universal design’s roots lie, it can be useful for designing for digital 
technology as well. Using a computer all day is fatiguing, so designs should minimize 
effort by making sure users don’t have to constantly move their cursor around a page 
to complete a task or make a task overly complicated.For example, relevant navigation 
should be anchored at the top of a webpage, so the user doesn’t have to scroll to the top 
whenever they wish to go to a different part of a website. 
 Size and space for approach and use-“Appropriate size and space is provided for 
approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user’s body size, posture, or 
mobility.”This is another principle that comes out of universal design’s origins in the 
built environment. Nonetheless, for UX designers, it’s a call to take into account the 
way the elements of a design are presented on a screen. These elements should be laid 
out and sized in a way that enables all users to touch, click or manipulate them.For 
example, we regularly interact with screens that range from very small to very large, 
but the same website or app shouldn’t be presented in the same way on a large computer 
screen as it is on a small mobile phone screen.In both cases, relevant buttons should be 
large enough for the user to touch or click them, but in the case of the computer, they 
shouldn’t be so small that we overlook them, and in the case of the mobile phone, they 
shouldn’t be so large that they make it impossible to comfortably see any other part of 
the screen. 
Inclusive Design 
Inclusive design describes methodologies to create products that understand and enable people 
of all backgrounds and abilities. Inclusive design may address accessibility, age, culture, 
economic situation, education, gender, geographic location, language, and race. The focus is 
on fulfilling as many user needs as possible, not just as many users as possible. 
Inclusive-Design Patterns: Examples 
During our research with seniors, one participant remarked, “One thing I don’t like about 
computers is they make the type too small on the screen.” To ensure legibility, designers must 
use reasonably large font sizes, have high contrast between characters in the foreground and 
background, and use a clean typeface. These characteristics are important to all users; however, 
older users are particularly challenged by interfaces with poor legibility because presbyopia, a 
form of farsightedness, is common after middle age. 
Throughout three rounds of research, the most common complaint from seniors has been that 
sites and apps are designed with young people in mind and are often hard to read for older 
3 | Page 
Mary Divya Shamili D (Asst.Prof-G1,(SOCSE),Presidency University 
users. In the words of one study participant: “the internet is unfriendly to people with bad 
eyesight.” To make your UIs more inclusive, opt for legible fonts and offer a button for users 
to increase the font size. 
Another common issue in old age is cataract or problems produced by cloudy ocular media. 
Individuals with such issues have trouble processing interfaces in light mode; to help them, 
consider (but do not enforce) a dark-mode option for your UIs and take advantage of any dark
mode APIs that various operating systems may offer so that users who decide to switch to a 
dark mode can still use your interface. 
Design for accessibility – Lens 
A lens is “a narrowed filter through which a topic can be considered or examined.” Often used 
to examine works of art, literature, or film, lenses ask us to leave behind our worldview and 
instead view the world through a different context.For example, viewing art through a lens of 
history asks us to understand the “social, political, economic, cultural, and/or intellectual 
climate of the time.” This allows us to better understand what world influences affected the 
artist and how that shaped the artwork and its message.Accessibility lenses are a filter that we 
can use to understand how different aspects of the design affect the needs of the users. Each 
lens presents a set of questions to ask yourself throughout the design process. By using these 
lenses, you will become more inclusive to the needs of your users, allowing you to design a 
more accessible user experience for all. 
 Lens Of Animation And Effects  
Effective animations can help bring a page and brand to life, guide the users focus, and help 
orient a user. But animations are a double-edged sword. Not only can misusing animations 
cause confusion or be distracting, but they can also be potentially deadly for some users.Fast 
flashing effects (defined as flashing more than three times a second) or high-intensity effects 
and patterns can cause seizures, known as ‘photosensitive epilepsy.’ Photosensitivity can also 
cause headaches, nausea, and dizziness. Users with photosensitive epilepsy have to be very 
careful when using the web as they never know when something might cause a seizure.Other 
effects, such as parallax or motion effects, can cause some users to feel dizzy or experience 
vertigo due to vestibular sensitivity. The vestibular system controls a person’s balance and 
sense of motion. When this system doesn’t function as it should, it causes dizziness and 
nausea.Constant animations or motion can also be distracting to users, especially to users who 
have difficulty concentrating. GIFs are notably problematic as our eyes are drawn towards 
movement, making it easy to be distracted by anything that updates or moves constantly.This 
isn’t to say that animation is bad and you shouldn’t use it. Instead you should understand why 
you’re using the animation and how to design safer animations. Generally speaking, you should 
try to design animations that cover small distances, match direction and speed of other moving 
objects (including scroll), and are relatively small to the screen size.You should also provide 
controls or options to cater the experience for the user. For example, Slack lets you hide 
animated images or emojis as both a global setting and on a per image basis.To use the Lens of 
Animation and Effects, ask yourself these questions: 
Are there any effects that could cause a seizure? 
Are there any animations or effects that could cause dizziness or vertigo through use of motion? 
4 | Page 
Mary Divya Shamili D (Asst.Prof-G1,(SOCSE),Presidency University 
Are there any animations that could be distracting by constantly moving, blinking, or auto
updating? 
Is it possible to provide controls or options to stop, pause, hide, or change the frequency of any 
animations or effects? 
 Lens Of Audio And Video  
Autoplaying videos and audio can be pretty annoying. Not only do they break a users 
concentration, but they also force the user to hunt down the offending media and mute or stop 
it. As a general rule, don’t autoplay media.You’re now probably asking, “But what if I autoplay 
the video in the background but keep it muted?” While using videos as backgrounds may be a 
growing trend in today’s web design, background videos suffer from the same problems as 
GIFs and constant moving animations: they can be distracting. As such, you should provide 
controls or options to pause or disable the video.Along with controls, videos should have 
transcripts and/or subtitles so users can consume the content in a way that works best for them. 
Users who are visually impaired or who would rather read instead of watch the video need a 
transcript, while users who aren’t able to or don’t want to listen to the video need subtitles.To 
use the Lens of Audio and Video, ask yourself these questions: 
Are there any audio or video that could be annoying by autoplaying? 
Is it possible to provide controls to stop, pause, or hide any audio or videos that autoplay? 
Do videos have transcripts and/or subtitles? 
 Lens Of Color  
Color plays an important part in a design. Colors evoke emotions, feelings, and ideas. Colors 
can also help strengthen a brand’s message and perception. Yet the power of colors is lost when 
a user can’t see them or perceives them differently.Color blindness affects roughly 1 in 12 men 
and 1 in 200 women. Deuteranopia (red-green color blindness) is the most common form of 
color blindness, affecting about 6% of men. Users with red-green color blindness typically 
perceive reds, greens, and oranges as yellowish.Color meaning is also problematic for 
international users. Colors mean different things in different countries and cultures. In Western 
cultures, red is typically used to represent negative trends and green positive trends, but the 
opposite is true in Eastern and Asian cultures.Because colors and their meanings can be lost 
either through cultural differences or color blindness, you should always add a non-color 
identifier. Identifiers such as icons or text descriptions can help bridge cultural differences 
while patterns work well to distinguish between colors.Oversaturated colors, high contrasting 
colors, and even just the color yellow can be uncomfortable and unsettling for some users, 
prominently those on the autism spectrum. It’s best to avoid high concentrations of these types 
of colors to help users remain comfortable.Poor contrast between foreground and background 
colors make it harder to see for users with low vision, using a low-end monitor, or who are just 
in direct sunlight. All text, icons, and any focus indicators used for users using a keyboard 
should meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 to the background color.You should also ensure 
your design and colors work well in different settings of Windows High Contrast mode. A 
common pitfall is that text becomes invisible on certain high contrast mode backgrounds.

To use the Lens of Color, ask yourself these questions: 
If the color was removed from the design, what meaning would be lost? 
How could I provide meaning without using color? 
Are any colors oversaturated or have high contrast that could cause users to become 
overstimulated or uncomfortable? 
Does the foreground and background color of all text, icons, and focus indicators meet contrast 
ratio guidelines of 4.5:1? 
 Lens Of Controls  
Controls, also called ‘interactive content,’ are any UI elements that the user can interact with, 
be they buttons, links, inputs, or any HTML element with an event listener. Controls that are 
too small or too close together can cause lots of problems for users.Small controls are hard to 
click on for users who are unable to be accurate with a pointer, such as those with tremors, or 
those who suffer from reduced dexterity due to age. The default size of checkboxes and radio 
buttons, for example, can pose problems for older users. Even when a label is provided that 
could be clicked on instead, not all users know they can do so.Controls that are too close 
together can cause problems for touch screen users. Fingers are big and difficult to be precise 
with. Accidentally touching the wrong control can cause frustration, especially if that control 
navigates you away or makes you lose your context.Controls that are nested inside another 
control can also contribute to touch errors. Not only is it not allowed in the HTML spec, it also 
makes it easy to accidentally select the parent control instead of the one you wanted.To give 
users enough room to accurately select a control, the recommended minimum size for a control 
is 34 by 34 device independent pixels, but Google recommends at least 48 by 48 pixels, while 
the WCAG spec recommends at least 44 by 44 pixels. This size also includes any padding the 
control has. So a control could visually be 24 by 24 pixels but with an additional 10 pixels of 
padding on all sides would bring it up to 44 by 44 pixels.It’s also recommended that controls 
be placed far enough apart to reduce touch errors. Microsoft recommends at least 8 pixels of 
spacing while Google recommends controls be spaced at least 32 pixels apart.Controls should 
also have a visible text label. Not only do screen readers require the text label to know what 
the control does, but it’s been shown that text labels help all users better understand a controls 
purpose. This is especially important for form inputs and icons. 
To use the Lens of Controls, ask yourself these questions: 
Are any controls not large enough for someone to touch? 
Are any controls too close together that would make it easy to touch the wrong one? 
Are there any controls inside another control or clickable region? 
Do all controls have a visible text label? 
 Lens Of Font 
In the early days of the web, we designed web pages with a font size between 9 and 14 pixels. 
This worked out just fine back then as monitors had a relatively known screen size. We 
designed thinking that the browser window was a constant, something that couldn’t be 
6 | Page 
Mary Divya Shamili D (Asst.Prof-G1,(SOCSE),Presidency University 
changed.Technology today is very different than it was 20 years ago. Today, browsers can be 
used on any device of any size, from a small watch to a huge 4K screen. We can no longer use 
fixed font sizes to design our sites. Font sizes must be as responsive as the design itself. Not 
only should the font sizes be responsive, but the design should be flexible enough to allow 
users to customize the font size, line height, or letter spacing to a comfortable reading level. 
Many users make use of custom CSS that helps them have a better reading experience.The font 
itself should be easy to read. You may be wondering if one font is more readable than another. 
The truth of the matter is that the font doesn’t really make a difference to readability. Instead 
it’s the font style that plays an important role in a fonts readability.Decorative or cursive font 
styles are harder to read for many users, but especially problematic for users with dyslexia. 
Small font sizes, italicized text, and all uppercase text are also difficult for users. Overall, larger 
text, shorter line lengths, taller line heights, and increased letter spacing can help all users have 
a better reading experience. 
To use the Lens of Font, ask yourself these questions: 
Is the design flexible enough that the font could be modified to a comfortable reading level by 
the user? 
Is the font style easy to read? 
Lens Of Images And Icons # 
They say, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Still, a picture you can’t see is speechless, 
right? 
Images can be used in a design to convey a specific meaning or feeling. Other times they can 
be used to simplify complex ideas. Whichever the case for the image, a user who uses a screen 
reader needs to be told what the meaning of the image is.As the designer, you understand best 
the meaning or information the image conveys. As such, you should annotate the design with 
this information so it’s not left out or misinterpreted later. This will be used to create the alt 
text for the image.How you describe an image depends entirely on context, or how much textual 
information is already available that describes the information. It also depends on if the image 
is just for decoration, conveys meaning, or contains text.Since knowing how to describe an 
image can be difficult, there’s a handy decision tree to help when deciding. Generally speaking, 
if the image is decorational or there’s surrounding text that already describes the image’s 
information, no further information is needed. Otherwise you should describe the information 
of the image. If the image contains text, repeat the text in the description as well. 
Descriptions should be succinct. It’s recommended to use no more than two sentences, but aim 
for one concise sentence when possible. This allows users to quickly understand the image 
without having to listen to a lengthy description. 
As an example, if you were to describe this image for a screen reader, what would you say? 
Since we describe the information of the image and not the image itself, the description could 
be Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night since there is no other surrounding context that 
describes it. What you shouldn’t put is a description of the style of the painting or what the 
picture looks like.

Mary Divya Shamili D (Asst.Prof-G1,(SOCSE),Presidency University 
If the information of the image would require a lengthy description, such as a complex chart, 
you shouldn’t put that description in the alt text. Instead, you should still use a short description 
for the alt text and then provide the long description as either a caption or link to a different 
page. 
This way, users can still get the most important information quickly but have the ability to dig 
in further if they wish. If the image is of a chart, you should repeat the data of the chart just 
like you would for text in the image. 
If the platform you are designing for allows users to upload images, you should provide a way 
for the user to enter the alt text along with the image. For example, Twitter allows its users to 
write alt text when they upload an image to a tweet. 
To use the Lens of Images and Icons, ask yourself these questions: 
Does any image contain information that would be lost if it was not viewable? 
How could I provide the information in a non-visual way? 
If the image is controlled by the user, is it possible to provide a way for them to enter the alt 
text description? 
 Lens Of Keyboard 
Keyboard accessibility is among the most important aspects of an accessible design, yet it is 
also among the most overlooked.There are many reasons why a user would use a keyboard 
instead of a mouse. Users who use a screen reader use the keyboard to read the page. A user 
with tremors may use a keyboard because it provides better accuracy than a mouse. Even power 
users will use a keyboard because it’s faster and more efficient. 
A user using a keyboard typically uses the tab key to navigate to each control in sequence. A 
logical order for the tab order greatly helps users know where the next key press will take them. 
In western cultures, this usually means from left to right, top to bottom. Unexpected tab orders 
results in users becoming lost and having to scan frantically for where the focus went. 
Sequential tab order also means that they must tab through all controls that are before the one 
that they want. If that control is tens or hundreds of keystrokes away, it can be a real pain point 
for the user. 
By making the most important user flows nearer to the top of the tab order, we can help enable 
our users to be more efficient and effective. However, this isn’t always possible nor practical 
to do. In these cases, providing a way to quickly jump to a particular flow or content can still 
allow them to be efficient. This is why “skip to content” links are helpful. 
A good example of this is Facebook which provides a keyboard navigation menu that allows 
users to jump to specific sections of the site. This greatly speeds up the ability for a user to 
interact with the page and the content they want. 
When tabbing through a design, focus styles should always be visible or a user can easily 
become lost. Just like an unexpected tab order, not having good focus indicators results in users 
not knowing what is currently focused and having to scan the page.

Mary Divya Shamili D (Asst.Prof-G1,(SOCSE),Presidency University 
Changing the look of the default focus indicator can sometimes improve the experience for 
users. A good focus indicator doesn’t rely on color alone to indicate focus (Lens of Color), and 
should be distinct enough to easily allow the user to find it. For example, a blue focus ring 
around a similarly colored blue button may not be visually distinct to discern that it is focused. 
Although this lens focuses on keyboard accessibility, it’s important to note that it applies to any 
way a user could interact with a website without a mouse. Devices such as mouth sticks, switch 
access buttons, sip and puff buttons, and eye tracking software all require the page to be 
keyboard accessible. 
By improving keyboard accessibility, you allow a wide range of users better access to your site. 
To use the Lens of Keyboard, ask yourself these questions: 
What keyboard navigation order makes the most sense for the design? 
How could a keyboard user get to what they want in the quickest way possible? 
Is the focus indicator always visible and visually distinct? 
 Lens Of Layout 
Layout contributes a great deal to the usability of a site. Having a layout that is easy to follow 
with easy to find content makes all the difference to your users. A layout should have a 
meaningful and logical sequence for the user. 
With the advent of CSS Grid, being able to change the layout to be more meaningful based on 
the available space is easier than ever. However, changing the visual layout creates problems 
for users who rely on the structural layout of the page. 
The structural layout is what is used by screen readers and users using a keyboard. When the 
visual layout changes but not the underlying structural layout, these users can become confused 
as their tab order is no longer logical. If you must change the visual layout, you should do so 
by changing the structural layout so users using a keyboard maintain a sequential and logical 
tab order. 
The layout should be resizable and flexible to a minimum of 320 pixels with no horizontal 
scroll bars so that it can be viewed comfortably on a phone. The layout should also be flexible 
enough to be zoomed in to 400% (also with no horizontal scroll bars) for users who need to 
increase the font size for a better reading experience. 
Users using a screen magnifier benefit when related content is in close proximity to one another. 
A screen magnifier only provides the user with a small view of the entire layout, so content that 
is related but far away, or changes far away from where the interaction occurred is hard to find 
and can go unnoticed. 
To use the Lens of Layout, ask yourself these questions: 
Does the layout have a meaningful and logical sequence? 
What should happen to the layout when it’s viewed on a small screen or zoomed in to 400%? 
Is content that is related or changes due to user interaction in close proximity to one another?

 Lens Of Material Honesty 
Material honesty is an architectural design value that states that a material should be honest to 
itself and not be used as a substitute for another material. It means that concrete should look 
like concrete and not be painted or sculpted to look like bricks. 
Material honesty values and celebrates the unique properties and characteristics of each 
material. An architect who follows material honesty knows when each material should be used 
and how to use it without tarnishing itself. 
Material honesty is not a hard and fast rule though. It lies on a continuum. Like all values, you 
are allowed to break them when you understand them. As the saying goes, they are “more what 
you’d call “guidelines” than actual rules.” 
When applied to web design, material honesty means that one element or component shouldn’t 
look, behave, or function as if it were another element or component. Doing so would cheat 
the user and could lead to confusion. A common example of this are buttons that look like links 
or links that look like buttons. 
Links and buttons have different behaviors and affordances. A link is activated with the enter 
key, typically takes you to a different page, and has a special context menu on right click. 
Buttons are activated with the space key, used primarily to trigger interactions on the current 
page, and have no such context menu. 
When a link is styled to look like a button or vise versa, a user could become confused as it 
does not behave and function as it looks. If the “button” navigates the user away unexpectedly, 
they might become frustrated if they lost data in the process. 
Where this becomes the most problematic is when a link and button are styled the same and 
are placed next to one another. As there is nothing to differentiate between the two, a user can 
accidentally navigate when they thought they wouldn’t. 
When a component behaves differently than expected, it can easily lead to problems for users 
using a keyboard or screen reader. An autocomplete menu that is more than an autocomplete 
menu is one such example. 
Autocomplete is used to suggest or predict the rest of a word a user is typing. An autocomplete 
menu allows a user to select from a large list of options when not all options can be shown. 
An autocomplete menu is typically attached to an input field and is navigated with the up and 
down arrow keys, keeping the focus inside the input field. When a user selects an option from 
the list, that option will override the text in the input field. Autocomplete menus are meant to 
be lists of just text. 
The problem arises when an autocomplete menu starts to gain more behaviors. Not only can 
you select an option from the list, but you can edit it, delete it, or even expand or collapse 
sections. The autocomplete menu is no longer just a simple list of selectable text. 
erstand it. A lot of work will be required to ensure the menu is accessible to a screen reader by 
using non-standard means. As such, it will might result in a sub-par or inaccessible experience 
for them.

Mary Divya Shamili D (Asst.Prof-G1,(SOCSE),Presidency University 
To avoid these issues, it’s best to be honest to the user and the design. Instead of combining 
two distinct behaviors (an autocomplete menu and edit and delete functionality), leave them as 
two separate behaviors. Use an autocomplete menu to just autocomplete the name of a user, 
and have a different component or page to edit and delete users. 
To use the Lens of Material Honesty, ask yourself these questions: 
Is the design being honest to the user? 
Are there any elements that behave, look, or function as another element? 
Are there any components that combine distinct behaviors into a single component? Does doing 
so make the component materially dishonest? 
 Lens Of Readability 
Have you ever picked up a book only to get a few paragraphs or pages in and want to give up 
because the text was too hard to read? Hard to read content is mentally taxing and tiring. 
Sentence length, paragraph length, and complexity of language all contribute to how readable 
the text is. Complex language can pose problems for users, especially those with cognitive 
disabilities or who aren’t fluent in the language. 
Along with using plain and simple language, you should ensure each paragraph focuses on a 
single idea. A paragraph with a single idea is easier to remember and digest. The same is true 
of a sentence with fewer words. 
Another contributor to the readability of content is the length of a line. The ideal line length is 
often quoted to be between 45 and 75 characters. A line that is too long causes users to lose 
focus and makes it harder to move to the next line correctly, while a line that is too short causes 
users to jump too often, causing fatigue on the eyes. 
You should also break up the content with headings, lists, or images to give mental breaks to 
the reader and support different learning styles. Use headings to logically group and summarize 
the information. Headings, links, controls, and labels should be clear and descriptive to enhance 
the users ability to comprehend. 
To use the Lens of Readability, ask yourself these questions: 
 Is the language plain and simple? 
 Does each paragraph focus on a single idea? 
 Are there any long paragraphs or long blocks of unbroken text? 
 Are all headings, links, controls, and labels clear and descriptive? 
 Lens Of Structure  
As mentioned in the Lens of Layout, the structural layout is what is used by screen readers and 
users using a keyboard. While the Lens of Layout focused on the visual layout, the Lens of 
Structure focuses on the structural layout, or the underlying HTML and semantics of the design. 
11 | Page 
Mary Divya Shamili D (Asst.Prof-G1,(SOCSE),Presidency University 
As a designer, you may not write the structural layout of your designs. This shouldn’t stop you 
from thinking about how your design will ultimately be structured though. Otherwise, your 
design may result in an inaccessible experience for a screen reader. 
Take for example a design for a single elimination tournament bracket. 
 
How would you know if this design was accessible to a user using a screen reader? Without 
understanding structure and semantics, you may not. As it stands, the design would probably 
result in an inaccessible experience for a user using a screen reader. 
To understand why that is, we first must understand that a screen reader reads a page and its 
content in sequential order. This means that every name in the first column of the tournament 
would be read, followed by all the names in the second column, then third, then the last. 
Screen reader to scan the page and get a high level overview. Screen readers can also jump to 
any heading. 
 Lists (ul and ol)-Group related items together, and allow a screen reader to easily jump 
from one item to another. 
 Buttons -Trigger interactions on the current page. 
 Links- Navigate or retrieve information. 
 Form labels-Tell screen readers what each form input is. 
Knowing this, how might we provide more meaning to a user using a screen reader? 
To start, we could group each column of the tournament into rounds and use headings to label 
each round. This way, a screen reader would understand when a new round takes place.Next, 
we could help the user understand which players are playing against each other each game. We 
can again use headings to label each game, allowing them to find any game they might be 
interested in. 
By just adding headings, the content would read as follows:

“__Round 1, Game 1__, George, Fred, __Game 2__, Linus, Lucy, __Game 3__, Jack, Jill, 
__Game 4__, Fred, Ginger, __Round 2, Game 5__, George, Lucy, __Game 6__, Jack, Ginger, 
__Round 3__, __Game 7__, George, Ginger, __Winner__, Ginger.” 
This is already a lot more understandable than before. 
The information still doesn’t answer who won a game though. To know that, you’d have to 
understand which game a winner plays next to see who won the previous game. For example, 
you’d have to know that the winner of game four plays in game six to know who advanced 
from game four. 
We can further enhance the experience by informing the user who won each game so they don’t 
have to go hunting for it. Putting the text “(winner)” after the person who won the round would 
suffice. 
We should also further group the games and rounds together using lists. Lists provide the 
structural semantics of the design, essentially informing the user of the connected nodes from 
the visual design. 
 
If we translate this back into a visual design, the result could look as follows: 
 
Since the headings and winner text are redundant in the visual design, you could hide them just 
from visual users so the end visual result looks just like the first design. 
“If the end result is visually the same as where we started, why did we go through all this?” 
You may ask. 
The reason is that you should always annotate your design with all the necessary structural 
design requirements needed for a better screen reader experience. This way, the person who 
implements the design knows to add them. If you had just handed the first design to the 
implementer, it would more than likely end up inaccessible. 
To use the Lens of Structure, ask yourself these questions:

Can I outline a rough HTML structure of my design? 
How can I structure the design to better help a screen reader understand the content or find the 
content they want? 
How can I help the person who will implement the design understand the intended structure? 
 Lens Of Time  
Periodically in a design you may need to limit the amount of time a user can spend on a task. 
Sometimes it may be for security reasons, such as a session timeout. Other times it could be 
due to a non-functional requirement, such as a time constrained test. 
Whatever the reason, you should understand that some users may need more time in order 
finish the task. Some users might need more time to understand the content, others might not 
be able to perform the task quickly, and a lot of the time they could just have been interrupted. 
Users who need more time to perform an action should be able to adjust or remove a time limit 
when possible. For example, with a session timeout you could alert the user when their session 
is about to expire and allow them to extend it. 
To use the Lens of Time, ask yourself this question: 
 Is it possible to provide controls to adjust or remove time limits? 
Design Sprint 
Design sprints are an intense 5-day process where user-centered teams tackle design problems. 
Working with expert insights, teams ideate, prototype and test solutions on selected users. 
Google’s design sprint is the framework to map out challenges, explore solutions, pick the best 
ones, create a prototype and test it.
