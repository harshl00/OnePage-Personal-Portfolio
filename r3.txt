To blink an **LED** on a **Raspberry Pi** for **5 times** with a **5-second delay** between each blink, you will use the **GPIO pins** of the Raspberry Pi and a simple Python script. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you set it up and execute the code.

### What You’ll Need:
1. **Raspberry Pi** (any model with GPIO support)
2. **1 LED**
3. **1 Resistor** (220-ohm resistor to protect the LED)
4. **Jumper Wires** (for connecting the components)
5. **Breadboard** (optional, but helps organize the wiring)

### Step 1: Wiring the LED to Raspberry Pi

#### GPIO Pin Explanation:
- We will use **GPIO pin 17** to control the LED.
- The **long leg (positive)** of the LED will be connected to **GPIO pin 17**.
- The **short leg (negative)** will be connected to the **GND (ground)** pin through a **220-ohm resistor**.

#### Wiring Instructions:
1. **Connect the LED**:
   - Connect the **long leg (positive)** of the LED to **GPIO pin 17**.
   - Connect the **short leg (negative)** of the LED to **one end of a 220-ohm resistor**.
   - Connect the **other end of the resistor** to the **GND (ground)** pin (3rd pin from the left on the outer row).

Your connection should look like this:
- **GPIO pin 17** → **LED (positive)** → **Resistor** → **GND**.

### Step 2: Installing the Necessary Python Libraries

You will need the **RPi.GPIO** library to control the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi.

1. **Install RPi.GPIO** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio
   ```

### Step 3: Python Code to Blink the LED 5 Times with a 5-Second Delay

Here is the Python script to make the LED blink 5 times, with a 5-second delay between each blink:

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO  # Import the GPIO library to control the pins
import time              # Import the time library to add delays

# Set up GPIO using BCM numbering (this refers to the pin numbers on the Broadcom chip)
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Define the GPIO pin for the LED
led_pin = 17  # Pin connected to the LED

# Set up the GPIO pin as output
GPIO.setup(led_pin, GPIO.OUT)

# Blink the LED 5 times with a 5-second delay
try:
    for i in range(5):  # Loop 5 times
        print(f"Blink {i+1}: LED ON")  # Print the blink number
        GPIO.output(led_pin, GPIO.HIGH)  # Turn the LED ON
        time.sleep(1)  # LED stays on for 1 second

        print(f"Blink {i+1}: LED OFF")
        GPIO.output(led_pin, GPIO.LOW)  # Turn the LED OFF
        time.sleep(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds before the next blink

finally:
    GPIO.cleanup()  # Reset the GPIO pins after the program finishes
```

---

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Libraries**:
   - `RPi.GPIO`: This library controls the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
   - `time`: Provides the ability to create delays using `time.sleep()`.

2. **GPIO Setup**:
   - `GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)` sets the pin numbering system to **BCM mode**, which refers to the GPIO numbers (like GPIO17, GPIO27, etc.).
   - `led_pin = 17` assigns **GPIO pin 17** to control the LED.

3. **Pin Setup**:
   - `GPIO.setup(led_pin, GPIO.OUT)` sets GPIO pin 17 as an output for the LED.

4. **Blinking the LED**:
   - The program uses a `for` loop to repeat the LED blink 5 times.
   - For each iteration of the loop:
     - The LED is turned **ON** using `GPIO.output(led_pin, GPIO.HIGH)`, and it stays on for **1 second** (`time.sleep(1)`).
     - The LED is then turned **OFF** using `GPIO.output(led_pin, GPIO.LOW)`, and there is a **5-second delay** (`time.sleep(5)`) before the next blink.

5. **Cleanup**:
   - After the program finishes, `GPIO.cleanup()` is called to reset the GPIO pins. This is important to release the pins and prevent issues with other programs that might use GPIO.

### Step 4: Running the Python Code

1. **Open the Terminal** on your Raspberry Pi.
2. **Navigate** to the folder where you saved the Python script (if saved as `blink_led.py`):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/script
   ```
3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 blink_led.py
   ```
   - The `sudo` command is necessary to access the GPIO pins.
   - The LED should blink **5 times**, with **5 seconds** between each blink.

4. **Stop the Program** (if needed):
   - The program will automatically stop after completing the 5 blinks, but you can manually stop it by pressing **Ctrl + C**.

### Conclusion:

Now you have a Python script to blink an LED 5 times with a 5-second delay between each blink using the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi. You can try modifying the script to change the delay or the number of blinks. Let me know if you need further help!
