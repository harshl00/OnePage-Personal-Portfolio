No worries! I’ll explain this step-by-step, as clearly as possible. Let’s dive into how to make 4 LEDs light up one by one (scrolling effect) using an Arduino Uno.

Objective:
We will connect 4 LEDs to the Arduino, and make them light up in a scrolling sequence, turning on one by one in a loop.

What You Need:
Arduino Uno: This is the main board that will control everything.
4 LEDs: Light-emitting diodes that we will light up in sequence.
4 Resistors: These limit the current going to the LEDs to protect them. Use 220-ohm resistors.
Jumper Wires: These are used to connect the LEDs, resistors, and Arduino.
Breadboard (optional): This is useful to organize your components, but you can directly connect everything if you don’t have one.
Components Breakdown:
Arduino Pins: These are the little holes on the Arduino board where you connect wires. We will use pins 8, 9, 10, and 11 for the 4 LEDs.
LED: Each LED has two legs. The longer leg (positive) goes to the Arduino, and the shorter leg (negative) connects to ground (GND) through a resistor.
Resistor: It will be connected to the shorter leg of the LED, and then to the GND pin on the Arduino.
How to Connect the Components:
Identify the pins on the Arduino: Look at your Arduino board. You’ll see a section marked DIGITAL with numbers like 0, 1, 2, etc. We will use pins 8, 9, 10, and 11 for this project.

Wiring the LEDs:

LED1:
Connect the long leg (positive) of LED1 to pin 8.
Connect the short leg (negative) of LED1 to one end of a resistor.
Connect the other end of the resistor to GND (ground, it’s the third pin from the left in the row marked "POWER").
LED2:
Connect the long leg (positive) of LED2 to pin 9.
Connect the short leg (negative) of LED2 to one end of a resistor.
Connect the other end of the resistor to GND.
LED3:
Connect the long leg (positive) of LED3 to pin 10.
Connect the short leg (negative) of LED3 to one end of a resistor.
Connect the other end of the resistor to GND.
LED4:
Connect the long leg (positive) of LED4 to pin 11.
Connect the short leg (negative) of LED4 to one end of a resistor.
Connect the other end of the resistor to GND.
Power:

The Arduino gets power either from the USB cable connected to your computer or from a separate power supply.


// Define which pins are connected to the LEDs
const int ledPins[] = {8, 9, 10, 11};  // The 4 LEDs are connected to pins 8, 9, 10, and 11.
const int numLEDs = 4;  // Total number of LEDs we are using.
const int delayTime = 300;  // This is the time (in milliseconds) between lighting up each LED.

void setup() {
  // Set each pin connected to an LED as an OUTPUT
  for (int i = 0; i < numLEDs; i++) {
    pinMode(ledPins[i], OUTPUT);  // Telling Arduino these pins will control LEDs
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Scroll LEDs from left to right (LED1 -> LED4)
  for (int i = 0; i < numLEDs; i++) {
    digitalWrite(ledPins[i], HIGH);   // Turn ON the LED connected to pin
    delay(delayTime);                 // Wait for the delay time
    digitalWrite(ledPins[i], LOW);    // Turn OFF the LED after delay
  }

  // Scroll LEDs from right to left (LED4 -> LED1)
  for (int i = numLEDs - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    digitalWrite(ledPins[i], HIGH);   // Turn ON the LED connected to pin
    delay(delayTime);                 // Wait for the delay time
    digitalWrite(ledPins[i], LOW);    // Turn OFF the LED after delay
  }
}


What the Code Does:
Defining Pins:

We tell the Arduino which pins are connected to the LEDs using const int ledPins[] = {8, 9, 10, 11};.
Setup Function:

This part of the code runs once when the Arduino is powered on.
pinMode() tells the Arduino that pins 8, 9, 10, and 11 are outputs (sending electricity to the LEDs).
Loop Function:

This part runs forever in a loop. It makes the LEDs scroll continuously.
First Loop: We light up the LEDs one by one from left to right (LED1 to LED4).
Second Loop: We light up the LEDs from right to left (LED4 to LED1).
The delay() function makes the LEDs pause before the next one lights up. You can change the number in delayTime to make it faster or slower (1000 = 1 second).
Steps to Execute:
Open Tinkercad: If you're using Tinkercad, set up your Arduino, LEDs, and resistors on the breadboard according to the wiring described above.

Upload the Code:

In Tinkercad, open the code editor.
Copy and paste the code above into the code editor.
Simulate:

Once your circuit is set up and the code is ready, click "Start Simulation".
You should see the LEDs lighting up one after the other, creating the scrolling effect.
If the LEDs are scrolling too fast or too slow, adjust the value of delayTime in the code (e.g., change 300 to 500 or 100).
What to Observe:
Left-to-right scrolling: The LEDs will light up in sequence from LED1 to LED4.
Right-to-left scrolling: After LED4 lights up, the sequence will reverse, with LEDs lighting up from LED4 to LED1.
